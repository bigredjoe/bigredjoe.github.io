There are several tools that I found invaluable to in my day to day life.

- [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - Intelligent flashcards. Helps you never forget the most important things.
- [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) - Resurfaces your book highlights so you stop forgetting everything you read in that book you loved.
- [Dwell](https://dwellapp.io/) - Hands down, the best way to listen to the Bible.
- [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) - My one place to capture almost all my brain's open loops.
- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) - My automation tool of choice on the Mac.
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - The todo app that has stuck with me to longest.
